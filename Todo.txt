Todo:
- Unit tests
- Make code more efficient/readable
- Documentation (annotated lecture slides, worked examples)
- Test case with moments, bending-extension, bending-twisting coupling
- Calculate and graph per-ply stress

Issues:
- Crimping is a factor. Currently assumes homogeneous unidirectional ply

Future Improvement:
- Tsai-Hill failure criterion
- Calculate stiffness matrix based on input material properties
