Todo:
- Variable ply properties
- Test case with moments, bending-extension, bending-twisting coupling
- Calculate and graph per-ply stress
- Calculate radii of curvature

Issues:
- Crimping is a factor. Currently assumes homogeneous unidirectional ply

Future Improvement:
- Tsai-Hill failure criterion
- Calculate stiffness matrix based on input material properties
  - Maybe just do the calculations in Excel and import the CSV?
